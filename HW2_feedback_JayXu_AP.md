Q1: Your initial line of code, df_raw.count(), would have given you the count of non-null values for all of the variables. <br>
Q8: Good use of seaborn, but another, simpler, way would also be to just use: *df.hist()* <br>
Q10: When you are trying to handle skewed data, you can try things like log transformation, squaring all the data etc.. <br>
Q12: What would you do with high-correlated variables? (Would you keep them all?)<br>
